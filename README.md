# Pushlog-App

You're hosting a server application like a backend or a game server? Then you need Pushlog!

With Pushlog, you see all important logs and errors from your server applications in one place - completely free. No matter if you install Pushlog onto your iPhone, iPad or Mac, your data is synced and always accessible and protected by your personal, unique access-token generated in the app.

Since we use a token-based authentication system, there's no need to create a user account in the traditional way. The first time you open Pushlog, you'll be prompted to either log in with your existing access-token or sign-up for a new, unique token. Every time you set up a new client for Pushlog, you use this token.

Pushlog uses highest-end encryption algorithms in order to protect your data! If you prefer hosting the Pushlog API on your own server, you can download the Pushlog backend from GitHub and set a custom API URL in the app.
